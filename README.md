## REST API Design Research

### Project Description

The research aims to study developer perception of different REST API error handling methodologies and aims to measure various metrics and provide evidence to improve this error handling. The repository provides starter code for getting started with 9 different API combinations. We have used Go Programming language and implemented the APIs with the help of [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) Framework.

 Weather (/weather) | Stock Market (/stockPrice) | Heart Rate (/heartRate) |
--- | --- | --- 
400 Bad Request | 400 Bad Request | 400 Bad Request |
500 Internal Server Error | 500 Internal Server Error | 500 Internal Server Error |
200 OK | 200 OK | 200 OK |
